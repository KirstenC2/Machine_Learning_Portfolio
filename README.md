# Machine_Learning_Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio. 
This repository would be used to store my projects related to machine learning, to demonstrate my skills.
Each project folder would consist of the necessary code, dataset used, and some supporting document for different projects.

## Project
### Project 1: Lung cancer risk prediction model using Random Forest

This project was my Final year project.
It is to develop a machine learning model which predict whether the lung cancer risk is there or not.
By using the data from Kaggle, the model is trained and tested.
Algorithm applied in this project is Random Forest, and output of the model is binary as it would classify the user "yes" or "no" for having lung cancer risk.
